# GitHub MCP Server Project Brief

## Overview
An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementation in Python that enables Cline to interact with GitHub issues. This server provides tools for reading and creating GitHub issues directly through Cline's interface.

## Core Requirements
- Integration with GitHub's REST API
- Read and list GitHub issues
- Create new GitHub issues
- Seamless integration with Cline
- Clear error handling and feedback
- Secure credential management

## Goals
1. Enable efficient GitHub issue management through Cline
2. Provide a robust and reliable MCP server implementation
3. Ensure secure handling of GitHub credentials
4. Maintain clean separation of concerns between MCP protocol and GitHub API interaction

## Success Criteria
- Successfully read existing GitHub issues
- Create new issues with proper formatting
- Handle authentication securely
- Provide clear feedback through Cline's interface
- Maintain stable connection between Cline and GitHub

## Scope
### In Scope
- GitHub issue reading
- GitHub issue creation
- Basic authentication
- Error handling
- MCP protocol implementation

### Out of Scope
- Issue comments management
- Pull request interactions
- Repository management
- GitHub project board integration

## Technical Constraints
- Python-based implementation
- MCP protocol compliance
- GitHub API rate limiting consideration
- OAuth authentication requirements
